# Covid-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) which started in the Wuhan province of China prompted a major outbreak that culminated in a worldwide pandemic. Several cases are being recorded across the globe which are close to 113 million with deaths being close to 2.5 million throughout the world. The increased number of cases and the newness of such a pandemic has resulted in the hospitals being under-equipped leading to problems in diagnosis of the disease. From previous studies, radiography has proved to be the fastest testing method . A screening test using the X-Ray scan of the chest region has proved to be effective. For this method, a trained radiologist is needed to detect the disease . Automating this process using deep learning models can prove to be effective. Due to the lack of a large dataset pre-trained CNN models are used in this study. Several models have been employed like VGG-16, Resnet-50, InceptionV3 and InceptionResnetV2 . Resnet-50 provided the best accuracy of 98.3%. The performance evaluation has been done using metrics like Receiver operating curve and confusion matrix.
